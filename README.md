# Day 3
 ## Task -1 
 Write a JavaScript function that returns the string with "something" appended
 with a space " " to the given string value.

 ## Task-2
Javascript program that will return an integer number corresponding to the
amount of digits in the given integer num.

## Task-3
Write a javascript program that returns `true` if the input string includes the string "ee"

## Task-4
"JavaScript program to display multiplication tables using user input integer value.
Ex. User Input: 2
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
….
2 * 10 = 20"

## Task-5
Write a JavaScript function that takes a two-digit number and determines if it's
the largest of two possible digit swaps
Ex:- If we give 43 as user input then it will return false because swapping 43
gives us 34, and 43 > 34."

## Task-6
Write a function that mimics (without the use of >>) the right shift operator and
returns the result from the two given integers.
Ex. 80 >> 3 = floor(80/2^3) = floor(80/8) = 10
-24 >> 2 = floor(-24/2^2) = floor(-24/4) = -6
## Task-7
Write a javascript program that takes in a number as a string n and returns the
number without trailing and leading zeros.
Ex. removeLeadingTrailing(""230.000"") ➞ ""230""
removeLeadingTrailing(""00402"") ➞ ""402""

## Task-8
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns the count of vowels
contained within it.
Ex. User Input : Celebration ➙ 5"

## Task-9
"Create a function that moves all capital letters to the front of a word.
Ex. ""hApPy"" ➞ APhpy"""
## Task-10
Sort the given string based on ASCII value
## Task-11
Create a function that takes two or more numbers as user input and adds them
together to get a new number. The function then repeatedly multiplies the digits
of the new number by each other, giving a new number, until the product is
returned only 1 digit long. Return the final value.
EX. User input - ""16 28"" then -- 16 + 28 = 44 after this it will add digits like this
 --4 * 4 = 16 until it gets only single digit as value-- 1 * 6 = 6
## Task-12
 write a Javascript program that takes a number as its argument and returns an
 array of all its factors.
 Ex. 12 ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
 4 ➞ [1, 2, 4]
## Task-13
.Create a JavaScript function that takes a String value as an input and capitalizes
 a letter if its ASCII value is even and returns its lowercase version if its ASCII
 value is odd.
 Ex. User Input: "THE LITTLE MERMAID"
 Output: "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"
## Task-14
 Write a JavaScript function that accepts a String with space-separated numbers
 and returns the highest and lowest number (as a string).
 Ex. User Input : "1 2 3 4 5"
 Output : "5 1"
