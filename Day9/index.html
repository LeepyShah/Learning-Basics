    <!-- Create a web page that contains two small circles of the same size one with a red fill
    and the other with a blue fill.
    ● Now make the first circle to be Dragable and when we put this circle in the
    second circle it will store that inside the second circle making it slightly smaller
    than the outer circle (Second Circle) and another circle should appear in place
    of the first one with different colour and same properties and when dragged
    and dropped inside the second circle it will again reduce the size of the circle
    such that it will fit inside previous two circles and the process should happen
    indefinitely and dropped circles size should be reduced every time to fit into
    previous circle until it turns to a dot. This code will create two circles, one with
    a red fill and the other with a blue fill. in short, The first circle will be draggable,
    and when it is dropped inside the second circle, it will be stored inside the
    second circle and a new circle with a random fill colour will appear in place of
    the first circle. The process will continue indefinitely, with the new circles being
    smaller and smaller until they turn into dots. -->
